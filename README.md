- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Victor-Huynh
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making the most out of JavaScript and the technologies that work with it. 

I think it is the most versatile language with a lot of modularity and I think I can get to the lategame with it if I put my mind to it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React with JS6 at the moment, and I'm looking to add TypeScript into the mix as soon as possible. 

Hooking up JS backend technologies at around the same timing as well, hopefully.
