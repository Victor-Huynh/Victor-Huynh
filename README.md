ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @Victor-Huynh

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making the most out of JavaScript and the technologies that work with it. 
I think it is the most versatile language with a lot of modularity and I think I can get to the lategame with it if I put my mind to it.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NextJS using the T3 Stack (https://t3.gg/) at the moment, and just slowly learning about why this was a popularized stack in the first place.

In my spare time, my favourite thing to do is to get active and play my two favourite sports: Volleyball and Basketball, and if the weather is not too great, you could catch me reading or learning about the human body or consuming volleyball/basketball content.
