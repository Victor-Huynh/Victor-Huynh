ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @Victor-Huynh

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making the most out of JavaScript and the technologies that work with it. 
I think it is the most versatile language with a lot of modularity and I think I can get to the lategame with it if I put my mind to it.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React with JS6 at the moment, and I'm looking to add TypeScript into the mix as soon as possible. 
Hooking up JS backend technologies at around the same timing as well, hopefully.

In my spare time, my favourite thing to do is to get active and play my two favourite sports: Volleyball and Basketball, and if the weather is not too great, you can probably catch me on Valorant from time to time.
I think it's about time that I truly focused on accelerating my career path, and the second half of 2021 is where I'm doing the full mental switch. Let's see how far I can take myself. I'm excited, and I'm ready to put in the work, just as I have for my sports/esports in the past.
